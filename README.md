### Hi there!

This is  responsive SPA that I built to use as my personal portfolio.
In this website, I'll be showcasing a bit of information about myself, along with my work and volunteering experiences.

This application was built with the following technologies
- **_NextJS_** was used to build the frontend
- **_Vercel_** was used to deploy the application to the web

### Where can I see the website?
