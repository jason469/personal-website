    <p>
      As a software developer for the past three years, I've built a strong technical foundation in software development,
      while also honing my professional skills through volunteer work. <br/><br/>

      I work hard to make sure that the project meets the deadlines set and take it upon myself to create a positive team environment. <br/>

      But Iâ€™m always looking at ways to improve the applications I build by constantly investigating new technologies and
      planning my projects thoroughly.
