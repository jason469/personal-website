                Since joining at the end of 2021, I've been the main developer in three separate projects and a co-developer in a fourth. <br>
                Each project involved me creating a responsive web application that needed to be widely scaleable and reliable, each with their own challenges.
                <br>
                I also co-developed a <strong>custom library</strong> for our team to use, which provided high level abstraction for mapping and graphing software using Mapbox<br>
                <br>
                In this role, I've worked extensively using Django, JavaScript, jQuery, Celery, Highcharts, Mapbox and Postgres. I
                also take the time to explore and experiment with different technologies and concepts to enhance my applications,
                using asynchronous tasks, websockets, new softwares and OOP to provide the best products for my clients. <br>
                <br>
                Working alongside other developers in my team has given me insight into good practises when working in a team, such
                as proper commenting and version control of code. Our mutual passion for web development means we're always pushing
                each other to perform the best we can and to constantly learn from each other.

                This was my first foray into web development, and I fell in love almost instantly. My main project during my three
                months here involved developing a new product to assess footpath quality. Beginning the project involved a lot of
                research, planning and scouring through academic literature. After that came the design and testing, and finally
                <strong>building the interface</strong><em> (i.e. the website)</em>.<br>
                <br>
                To build this website, I used Django as the backend framework, hooked with Postgres as my database. Simple
                JavaScript and jQuery was used to give additional functionality to my HTML pages, and within 3 months, I had created
                my first functional prototype. <br>
                <br>
                This role gave me the technical foundations needed to become a web developer, introducing me to new concepts and
                practises that I'd never encountered in University. It was also my first time leading a project from start to
                finish, but most importantly, it <strong>set me on the path</strong> towards becoming a developer.

                My first ever job in a technical field, but I learnt so much from it.
                In my 3 months at Navico, I organised and conducted stage 2 testing phases for two devices, while also performing
                smaller tests on other devices. This involved performing a series of tests ranging from IP moisture tests,
                durability tests and environmental tests. Part of this process also meant creating my own testing rigs<br>
                <br>
                But this internship is where I really learnt the importance of time management and proper documentation. Juggling so
                many concurrent tests with limited equipment meant I had to plan weeks in advance, and be as efficient as possible.
                Good documentation also meant learning how to properly use Microsoft Word and Excel, making full use of the formulas
                and styling within them.
                <br><br>
                While this position wasn't what I ultimately delved into, I'm still grateful for the lessons I learnt from there.
