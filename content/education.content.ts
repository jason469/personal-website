      During my degree, I gained exposure to circuit design, control systems theory, IoT and software development.
      And although my passion now lies in web development, studying at University helped me build a focused and eager mindset.

      <br/><br/>

      University was also where I practised a plethora of my professional and personal skills. I was involved
      in a number of student committees and boards, all aimed towards building a healthier and happier
      student community. I also took part in various speech and case competitions,
      all to better develop my speaking and presentation skills.
